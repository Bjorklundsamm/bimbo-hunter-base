# Core Flask web framework
flask==3.0.3

# Image processing for user uploads
pillow==10.4.0

# Note: Other dependencies (blinker, click, itsdangerous, jinja2, MarkupSafe, werkzeug)
# are automatically installed as Flask dependencies

# Paimon dependencies are now managed separately in p(ai)mon/requirements.txt
# This keeps the main app lightweight and separates concerns
